#Learning Journal Day 11
Today we discussed Project Week, absolute and relative positioning, and applying what we have learned about constructor functions to randomly display images for our Bus Mall lab.

We didn't have to learn much in terms of new material for this lab, but it is more complex in application and is more cumulative. The basics of displaying 3 random images side-by-side, and tracking how many times the user has clicked, is easy peasy. Making it so that there are no image repeats among the 3? No idea how to do. None at all.
