#Learning Journal Day 10
Today we learned more styling with CSS with the Wireframe Excercise, and the timed Chocolate Pizza lab. CSS is challenging in a different way than JS. It is so simple, but nearly infinite in its ability to style. Having so many options makes remembering everything difficult even though the basis underneath is way easier than JS. Thank god I live in the age of Google.

The Chocolate Pizza lab went really well. I turned it in with 1 minute to spare, and am fairly happy with my result. I really would have like just 4 more minutes to change the font of the word Delicious, and pad the ingredients list, but overall I did better than I expected myself to do.

The demo today was extremely useful and applicable to today's work.
