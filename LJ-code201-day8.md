#Learning Journal Day 8

Today we worked more on the Salmon Cookies project by adding a footer to our table, a form, and an event.

I was stressing hardcore through the lecture because I didn't fully complete yesterday's work, but everything went really well today. Getting a good night's sleep helped, and the demo for today was very clear and applicable. I was able to complete yesterday's lab, and complete today's lab, which I wasn't expecting to be able to do. The hint during class about the nested for loops helped guide me, and I think it worked especially well with how I had my code set up.
