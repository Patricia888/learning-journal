#Learning Journal Day 5

Today we learned more about forking and branches in GitHub. We learned to work on branches, not the master copy, and how to merge branches with the master. The exercise today was a nice mix of functions practice and more familiarization with GitHub. It helped me to think more like a coder.

I am getting to know the people in my class better and making connections, so I feel more comfortable about asking them things, or offering to look at their code.
