#Learning Journal Day 4

Today we learned about properly ordering our code; how to organize our if else statements, the proper place to call functions, at the bottom, and that global variable should all be defined at the top.
We learned more about html and css, and the proper way to use functions, at least for the duration of 201. We learned how to fork and merge PR on GitHub.
We did pair programming and I loved it. Two brains really truly are better than one. I got better at debugging, and learned a lot of useful keyboard shortcuts from my partner.
Things are running more smoothly, in and out of the classroom. I know most people's faces, if not names, and know the building and surrounding area better, so I am more relaxed.
