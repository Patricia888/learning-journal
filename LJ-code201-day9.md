#Learning Journal Day 9

Today we went over Allie's solution to the Salmon Cookie project. It was very useful to see the way she achieved the same result. Her way was way better than mine; mine works but is more convoluted.

I worked on styling my Salmon Cookie index and sales pages, and it was more difficult than I thought because I tried to get really fancy because I had extra time, and then used up my extra time trying to overreach, lol. I didn't achieve my original intention of repeating an image down the side of my Salmon Cookie page but I learned a lot of other stuff that can be done with images, so it definitely was not a waste.
