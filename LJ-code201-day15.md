# Learning Journal Day 15

Today we discussed the Google Teams article. We talked about positive actions that each team member can take, and the results to the team culture. I loved reading this article. It was brilliant and informative, and I greatly enjoyed the in-class discussion, and hearing the other student's takeaways. Meeting Brook Riggio was a pleasure, and reinforced my trust and admiration of Codefellows to see that he was passionate about positivity and pyschological safety in team settings.

We reviewed a solution to the Busmall order form lab. That was helpful, but I feel there is a lot I am missing on that assignment in the details. I am glad that I understood every line of code individually.

We also had a Partner Power Hour, that mostly went over my head because it was all about Python. But it was good to see sample Python code.

We were assigned our Project Week groups today, did a stand-alone lab with them, and talked about our final project for 201. I love my group. I was super tired going in to the group lab and was worried that I might not pull my weight, but the group synergy energized me and we got the work done and I had fun. We all had great project ideas, and easily settled on one. I got pretty excited about the project and I think I talked a little too much at the end there, but not too bad. I'll be more mindful of equality in distribution of conversation in the future.
