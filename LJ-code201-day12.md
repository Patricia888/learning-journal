#Learning Journal Day 12
Today I did a white boarding session. I was terrified, but I think I did alright. It did a very good job of illustrating what I know without referencing the book or previously written code, and I'm mostly satisfied with how I did.

In lecture, we learned about chart.js, how awesome having access to such a library is, and how to put charts and graphs from that library in projects to display data.
