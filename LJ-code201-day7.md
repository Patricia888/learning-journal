#Learning Journal Day 7

Today was really tough. This was the first day I had to go home with the lab incomplete. I get the overall concept of constructor functions and their properties now, which I didn't at first, but the TAs were constantly busy today so I didn't get much opportunity for help.
I really hope starting Wednesday behind won't hold me back too much. I really want to get this done.
