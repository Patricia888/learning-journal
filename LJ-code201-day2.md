# Learning Journal Day 2

Today we learned about arrays, if/else conditionals, and we are now pros at APC.

I am liking class so far. The projects are tough but not too tough. Everyone is friendly.
Things don't seem fully organized, but it is only the 2nd day of class.

The prework has been very helpful to my understanding so far.
