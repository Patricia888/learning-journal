# Learning Journal Day 14

This assignment was absolutely brutal. I was so stressed I couldn't think. We spent 5 1/2 hours on this before Allie said to do our final commits and go home. We had such huge GitHub and commit troubles. The worst part was we spent about half of the whole time trying to sort out merge conflicts, branches, what info was where, and git push/pull errors. It was super depressing to put so much energy into the not-coding part of the project.

It did teach very valuable lessons though. And I learned I have a very good handle on the concepts, as I was able to outline what I want to do no problem, and felt very good about it.
