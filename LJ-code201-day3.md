# Learning Journal Day 3

Today's project was very tough but excellent practice. I had trouble with ol and ul because the reset css was nulling the bullet points and numbers. That took awhile to figure out. Adding the first question that took a number as input was not too hard, and my favorite part of this project. Adding the second question that has an array of possible answers frustrated me and took a lot of the time spent. The tallying the answers part would have taken me forever since I started going about it in a very roundabout way, but one of the TA's helped me see a straightforward way, that illustrated the importance of planning.

The TA's are very helpful and knowledgable. I am impressed. I wish we did more excersises on the material in-class.
The environment here is very comfortable and conducive to learning.
