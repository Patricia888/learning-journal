#Learning Journal Day 6

Today we learned about Objects, and the keys and values within objects. This was a hard hard day for me. I get it in its simple form, and I think I uderstand now, but when we threw a bunch of arrays, and loops, and arrays inside loops into the mix, I got super mixed up. The CSS part was easy, but I just didn't have the time or energy to do much with it when I was finally done with the JS part, after about 7 hours. I just kinda threw the CSS in there..... and it looked better than expected. Definitely low-effort, but I did alright.
This assignment more than the previous ones illustrates that there are multiple ways to do the same thing. Which is good, but some of those ways are more 'right' than others. Thank god for pseudocode.
